# IoTMaskDetectionTempReader
Final project for Internet of Things at the University of Iowa. This software runs on a raspberry pi and utilizes both a thermal camera and a USB camera to detect if a person is using a mask, read their temperature, and upload that data to a database and inform the admin if entry is denied.
